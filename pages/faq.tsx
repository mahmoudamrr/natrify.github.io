        <Accordion title="What are the advantages of bioplastic products?">
          Bioplastic is a sustainable material derived from renewable feedstocks, and is an alternative to petroleum-based plastics. It has
          the potential to reduce 30-70% of carbon dioxide emission. It represents approximately 42% reduction of carbon footprints. The
          production of bioplastic requires 65% less energy than conventional petroleum plastic.

          The global bioplastics market was valued at $5.8 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $16.8 billion by 2030, growing at a
          CAGR of 11.5% from 2021 to 2030.

          According to the PRO BIP study conducted by the University of Utrecht, bioplastics could technically substitute about 85 percent
          of conventional plastics, so this is not a realistic short- or mid-term development
